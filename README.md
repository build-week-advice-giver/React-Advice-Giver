Advice Giver

PROJECT NAME
Advice Giver


DESCRIPTION
Pitch: This app 
creates room for an online global community just for you to connect with, and only one call away! You can choose to be the expert advisor, or the one who receives advice, or both! If you get a match, you both decide how to engage in the advisory relationship, assess if the advice is helpful or not, and when to move on—sounds like a normal relationship, right?
Try it out! And leave no one behind, because a more connected world should never feel lonely for anyone.
Mvp:
*Onboarding process and user profile set up for two user types: advisors and those seeking advice.  Might include photo, age, gender, life motto (optional), interests, areas of expertise, certifications (if any), social media links, geographic location, language skills etc.).
*Ability to easily edit/update/delete profile info
If account setting is on "get advice":
*Ability to easily create and post a question (including title, question, question type (ie business, career advice, personal development, desired time commitment from and advisor etc.) , and optional stretch goal photos/files). You can also add filters according to preferences (area of expertise, language, gender, years of experience, geographic location etc.); 3) Post as either public ( to appear on question feed) or private.
*tab for the user to view and edit or delete their posted questions (both public and private)
* “Mentor tab” for users to see which advisors have offered to help them
If user type is on "give advice":
*An advisory feed tab will display questions and requests set on public mode throughout the day. Select a question if interested in advising a person needing advice. If they select a question, their user name and email will be added to that users “mentor tab”

Stretch: Ability for a user to sign up to both give and receive advice. Toggle a view for the logged in user to see different account abilities. (Similar to Airbnb and toggling to host view).
Ability to upload files or photos with a question.

Create React App Info Below vvvvvvvvvvvv

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
